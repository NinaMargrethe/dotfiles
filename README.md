***macsetup.script***
This script is tailored to my needs and preferences as a backend developer working on a Macbook.
It uses osascript aka applascript, and should configure everything I need at the click of a button.
.script files runs in MacOS Script Editor, you'll need to build and run it maually from there. 
The script provides no output as of yet. 

Clone and run at your own risk.
